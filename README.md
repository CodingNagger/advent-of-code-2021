# advent-of-code-2021

Going through the Advent of code 2021 using Java. Should be a fun ride. Also I have a blog if you want you can [check it out here](https://www.codingnagger.com/) or ping me on [Minds @CodingNagger](https://minds.com/CodingNagger).

## How to run it

```
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

## Running tests

```
mvn clean test
```

## Cruise log

Last year I ran a [cruise log for my 25 days competing in the Advent of Code](https://www.codingnagger.com/tag/advent-of-code-2020/) and decided I would at least try to do the same this year.
